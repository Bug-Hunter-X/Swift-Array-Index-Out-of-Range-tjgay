# Swift Array Index Out of Range
This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: the "index out of range" error.  This occurs when you attempt to access an element in an array using an index that is not valid within the array's bounds.

The `bug.swift` file shows the error occurring, while `bugSolution.swift` provides solutions to prevent it.
